this is a realtime fraud detection system made using kafka producer and consumer i primarilly simulated the data since i dint have access to realtime data using kafka producer
the system works by alerting the user of any fraudlent activities the second they occur 
this mainly occurs by the credit card user sets parameters on which a transaction or activity on the card occurs it will be flagged as fraud eg if i live in nairobi and fraud occurs
at any other place it will be flagged as fraud and many other more parameters
